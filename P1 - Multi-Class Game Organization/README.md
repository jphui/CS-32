# Project 1 - Multi-Class Game Organization

**Project Description**

Given a compilable single file containing all the code for a simple top-down game, split it up into meaningful files: pairs for each class (.h, .cpp), globals, main, etc. The resulting project should build and behave exactly as the original single-file program and should have appropriate '#include' guards.

Then, add a "history" feature to the game. Given the public interface, implement the class so that upon pressing a certain key, the player's movement history is displayed on the screen.

**Description of Files**
