# Homework 3 - Insertion Sort Analysis

**Project Description**

Given function definitions and an incomplete main routine that performs and analyzes sorting, implement the required functionality.

Then, using the working code, quantitatively prove to yourself that insertion sort on an unordered set is O(N^2) by sorting with incremental dataset sizes. Notice how insertion set performs linearly, O(N), on the sorted set. Compare how the algorithm performs against the STL sort algorithm when used with both object instances and pointers to object instances.
