# Homework 4 - Implementing a Binary Search Tree

**Project Description**

Given a class (and node) definition for a Binary Search Tree of an abstract data type (described in WordTree.h), implement the member functions to behave robustly.

**Description of Files**

WordTree.h

- Header file containing the class (and node) definition from the specification as well as (private) helper data members/functions that I added.

WordTree.cpp

- My implementation of the functions defined in the header file.

main.cpp

- My driver code that tests my solution, employing categorical abstraction of test cases to streamline the debugging process.
