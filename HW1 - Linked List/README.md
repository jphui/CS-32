# Homework 1 - Implementing a Linked List

**Project Description**

Given a class definition for a Linked List of an abstract data type (described in LinkedList.h), implement the member functions to behave robustly. Member functions include: insertion, appendation, element reversal and retrieval.

**Description of Files**

LinkedList.h

- Spec-defined interface.

LinkedList.cpp

- My implementation of the member functions.

main.cpp

- My driver code that thoroughly tests my solution, employing categorical abstraction of test cases to streamline the debugging process.
